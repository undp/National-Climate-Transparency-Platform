    "faqQ1": "What is the National Climate Transparency Platform?",
    "faqA1": "The primary purpose of the National Climate Transparency Platform (NCTP) is to allow government ministries, agencies, departments, and optional outside observers to easily track and report the progress and support (financing, technology transfer, and capacity build) of climate actions in your country over time.  With the NCTP, important information can be saved by different users, stored long term, and accessed within seconds. Users can deep dive to find specific information when it is needed. Common Tabular Format tables under the Enhanced Transparency Framework are filled out automatically to expedite reporting to UNFCCC",
    "faqQ2": "Is it easy to use the National Climate Transparency Platform? ",
    "faqA2": "The National Climate Transparency Platform (NCTP) is built with usability as a priority by using the standard information structure that governments and development partners use to define their: national climate actions, sectoral programmes, specific projects & activities, and financing of these.  The NCTP allows users to easily input the 30+ types of information required for reporting under the Enhanced Transparency Framework, in addition to defining and tracking key sustainable development indicators defined by your government, AND by storing other important information so that others can access it within seconds.",
    "faqQ3": "What value is gained from using the National Climate Transparency Platform? ",
    "faqA3": "The National Climate Transparency Platform (NCTP) helps governments optimise the management of information related to climate change actions and support across ministries, agencies, and departments.  It also allows for the option to easily share this information with parties outside government, such as UNFCCC, development partners, education institutions…etc.   The NCTP can potentially save 1000s of person-hours of work due to important information being stored in a single digital location, having ease of access to this information, and by offering standard reporting of Enhanced Transparency Framework information.",
    "faqQ4": "What types of customisations are possible with the National Climate Transparency Platform?",
    "faqA4": "The National Climate Transparency Platform (NCTP) is built as open-source software and, in principle, is highly customisable.  Where the basis open-source software allows for flexibility as well. Some of the most common areas of customisation and flexibility are: <ul><li><b>User Types:</b> The categories of users, roles, responsibilities and rights for each user type in the NCTP.</li><li><b>Institutions, Partners and Sectors:</b> Governments can easily customise the list of national institutions and development partners applicable to the country.  In addition, to easily customise the sectors and sub-sectors that national actions address.</li><li><b>Verification of Information:</b> Defining which specific users have the right to verify the information input to the NCTP.</li><li><b>Documentation:</b> Documentation (files) for individual climate actions, programmes, projects and activities can be uploaded into the NCTP for later use and review.</li><li><b>Data Parameters:</b> Custom data parameters chosen by governments can be added.</li><li><b>Key Performance Indicators: </b> The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of climate actions, programmes, projects and activities are easily added in the NCTP.  In addition, KPIs for sustainable development and ministerial planning can be added.</li><li><b>Reporting: </b> The NCTP has a standard reporting module for many of the Common Tabular Formats (CTFs) of the Enhanced Transparency Framework; governments can choose to add more CTFs or customise reporting specifically for government needs.</li><li><b>API Integration: </b> Enabling automated data input/export through APIs to integrate with other local and national systems.</li><li><b>Data Hosting & Security: </b> Customizing data hosting locations, databases, and security protocols to meet the country’s unique requirements.</li></ul>",
    "faqQ5": "Who can use the source code?",
    "faqA5": "The National Climate Transparency Platform source code is developed and maintained by UNDP and is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0), which permits free use, modification, and sharing of the software.",
    "faqA5-2": "We kindly ask users to inform us of your usage by contacting <a>digital4planet@undp.org</a> as this helps us track the tool’s impact and guide future improvements.",

    "faqQ6": "What resources are needed to deploy, use, and maintain the National Climate Transparency Platform? ",
    "faqA6": "<b>System hosting:</b> Countries are expected to host and maintain the software independently after installation. This means countries should plan on having human and financial resources to host the software and data. There are two main hosting options: <ul><li><b>Cloud Hosting:</b> Cloud hosting offers flexibility, reliability, and integrated security, typically with managed backup and maintenance features. These services generally require a recurring fee, often monthly or annual, which can vary based on usage, storage, and service level.</li><li><b>Local Hosting:</b> Countries can host the system on local servers to gain more direct control over data and security. Countries must manage all configuration, security, backup, and ongoing maintenance based on their local IT environment and security protocols.</li></ul>",
    "faqA6-2": "<b>National Technical Experts:</b> Experience in implementing the National Climate Transparency Platform (NCTP) in countries shows that two types of national technical expertise are needed: <ul><li><b>National Transparency Expert:</b> An expert with deep knowledge of the climate change information and related national systems in the country (e.g. MRV, GHG Inventory, BURs/BTRs, sectoral information…).  This person would help find where to customise the NCTP to meet national needs, assist with the information processes, conduct training and prepare related training materials for national stakeholders.</li><li><b>National IT Expert:</b> An expert who has good knowledge of open-source code and UX/UI, plus, experience with institutional IT systems in the country (especially environmental software).   This person would help customise the NCTP to meet national needs, set up hosting, and conduct training.</li></ul>",
    "faqA6-3": "<b>National Training:</b> Extensive training of selected national stakeholders is needed to implement the use of the NCTP across government and selected partners.   This training typically includes workshops and online courses.",
    
    "faqQ7": "What support can UNDP provide?",
    "faqA7": "The UNDP Digital for Planet team, through local UNDP country offices, can offer support in several areas (subject to discussion):<ul><li><b>Resources and Templates:</b> Access to template workplans, process flows, and other tools to assist in customising and configuring the DTS.</li><li><b>Training and International Expertise:</b> Support from experts in product management, IT, enhanced transparency, and policy to provide guidance, ensure quality assurance, and facilitate knowledge transfer.</li><li><b>Community of Practice:</b> Ongoing access to an international community of practice for support and collaboration of using climate change digital tools for enhanced transparency.</li></ul>",
